Pull the source code and hack away. TestsTests are a work in progress now, and will be released soon. DocumentationBuilding the Main DocumentationDocumentation is generated, and, optionally, pushed to GitHub pages via a grunt-based build process. Generated documentation is placed in doc/generated. The doc/generated folder will be removed and re-created as part of any documentation build. To generate documentation from the JSDoc in the code, do grunt doc:master or grunt doc:current-version. The names of the two functions are a bit deceptive: both will generate documentation from the branch and version of the module from which you are running grunt. The difference is that the former places the documentation into the doc/generated/master file, and the latter places it in the doc/generated/$version file, where $version is the NPM package version from package.json. Building the Version Index Documentationgrunt doc:index can be used to build just the documentation landing page, which contains links to multiple module versions' documentation. grunt doc:index is implied as part of all other grunt doc tasks. The index will live in doc/generated/index.html. Unless you build a version's documentation in addition to the index, links in the index will not work. Pushing Documentation to GitHub PagesYou can add :push to either the doc:master or doc:current-version Grunt task to push the resulting documentation product to GitHub pages, e.g. grunt doc:master:push. Before pushing, the build system will delete and re-create the index documentation (regardless of target), and documentation for the version-named (or master-named) folder you are targeting, depending on which Grunt task you're pushing with. × Search results Close "},"tutorial-VersionIndex.html":{"id":"tutorial-VersionIndex.html","title":"Tutorial: Other Versions","body":" classeur-downloader Tutorials Developer's GuideOther Versions Other Versions classeur-api-clientThis is the documentation landing page for classeur-api-client, a node.js client for the REST API of http://classeur.io/.
